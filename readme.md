Hi! This is my first Java package that I wrote for my Java class' first assignment. This code was written by me with no hand holding by the professor.

The objective of this homework assignment was to use inheritance and polymorphism to create a "system" that lets you enter info for a student, indicate if they are an in-person or remote student, their grades for the semester (midterm, final, assignments, discussions), and their final weighted grade for the course.
